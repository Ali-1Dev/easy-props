## What is ADP4J ?

Annotation Driven Properties For Java is a library that allows you to inject configuration properties in your objects in a declarative way using annotations.

The idea behind ADP4J is to implement the "Inversion Of Control" principle : Instead of having objects looking actively for configuration properties, these objects simply declare configuration properties they need and these properties will be provided to them by a tool, ADP4J for instance!
